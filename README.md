# Guess A Number App
 - First React-Native app I created with Expo following the course React Native - The Practical Guide [2021 Edition] on Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
 - The course was done step by step, with opportunities to pause and tinker with styles and custom components on your own.

# How To Play
- Select a number between 1-100
- Confirm your selection
- The computer will try to guess your number, tell it to go either higher or lower
- Repeat until the computer guesses your number
- The end screen will tell you how many guesses the computer needed, and give you an option to start a new game
